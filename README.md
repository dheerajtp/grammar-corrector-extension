A grammar correction browser extension created using ReactJS, OpenAI, and Node.js

## Lessons Learned

I integrated Open AI with Node.js and created a browser extension using React.JS.

## Optimizations

I integrated an API call in React JS using the React Query package and created a proper folder structure for better usability.
